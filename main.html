	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. It is important to analyze time complexity to ensure that an algorithm is efficient, especially when dealing with large data sets.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. It is important to consider Space Complexity, as an algorithm that consumes too much memory can lead to performance issues. For example, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity means that the amount of space needed grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
